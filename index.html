<div class="WordSection1"><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><em><strong>Article by Bryson Chew &amp; Jean Choo</strong></em></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In 2023, amidst various estate renewal plans, the masterplan for Bayshore provoked a significant interest from potential home buyers. Located adjacent to the East Coast Park beach, the state announced plans for this new estate in October. The Bayshore estate is expected to provide around 10,000 homes, dividing the components into 7,000 units for public housing, while the remaining 3,000 will constitute private residential units.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Bayshore estate, a 60-hectare property in an excellent location, could offer residences with unrestricted views of the sea. The estate benefits from great transportation links, with two soon-to-be MRT stations (Bayshore and Bedok South on the Thomson-East Coast Line), making it highly accessible. Future inhabitants will have access to new facilities to be constructed within the estate, along with the existing recreational opportunities at the East Coast Park beach.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Bayshore masterplan has been eagerly awaited by house hunters who want to live by the beach as private residential launches and public housing projects have been nonexistent in the area for some time. Most of the nearby residences consist of older condos and aging HDB apartments. The last newly launched condo in the area, Seaside Residences, was completely sold out by October 2021, having been launched in 2017. The latest HDB build-to-order (BTO) project to be offered in the area was Bedok South Horizon, back in November 2016.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

The first two Build-To-Order (BTO) projects in Bayshore are slated for delivery by the Housing Development Board (HDB), potentially under the Plus flat model. Furthermore, a private residential property has been included in the Reserve List under the Government Land Sales Programme for the first half of 2024.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The government has announced that Singapore’s East Coast might undergo a transformation. Studies will be conducted for a project that may span over several decades, which will involve restoration works along the beachfront. The 800-hectare restored area, dubbed as Long Island, is expected to serve as a barrier against rising sea levels. Further, it will also open avenues for new residential and recreational infrastructures.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It would be reasonable to suggest there may be significant growth potential for properties situated along the East Coast. Yet, how have Bayshore's residential prices fared thus far? PropNex Picks dives into the data for four condominium projects in the Bayshore planning subzone to examine the stability of home prices. The basis of these selections was their closeness to the emerging Bayshore estate, substantial developmental size, and the quantity of resale deals made within the prior year (2022 – Oct 2023).</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;

The unfolding developments in public transport infrastructure, such as the gradual operation of the Thomson-East Coast Line and a future station in Bayshore, could be another facet backing the sustenance of home prices.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">An examination of profits from the four developments has been carried out, the results of which are presented in Table 1. The surplus units sold from January 2022 to November 2023 are generally profitable and maintained average holding periods exceeding 10 years (spanning from 11 to 17 years). The average annualised returns across all resale transactions of the four projects ranged between 3.8% and 5%, providing an average profit from $396,000 up to more than $920,000.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><img width="600" height="243" src="http://test0398.online/uploads/6992a724c51c98bba767d16f84ee89.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_6" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;" alt=""></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

According to the caveats from URA Realis, the mean unit price for newly sold private homes within the Bedok Planning Area, where Bayshore is situated, was $2,092 psf until 30 November in 2023. Concurrently, the mean reselling price at Seaside Residences, one of Bedok Planning Area's latest projects, was $2,166 psf in the same year. Given the buzz and anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bayshore estate, it is quite probable that private home prices in that area could surpass present levels.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When bidding for land and setting unit prices, developers will evaluate the affordability limit of the local population - this could provide a steady source of demand from those seeking to upgrade.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">A homebuyer who is looking to acquire a $2 million property, with a Loan-to-Value (LTV) limit at 75% and a 30-year loan period at a 4% interest rate, would require a minimum monthly household income of slightly more than $13,000. This is considering the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework, which mandates that a borrower's monthly mortgage repayment shouldn't surpass 55% of their monthly household income.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Based on the earnings records of residents in the Bedok Planning Region, more than 35% of domiciles have a gross monthly income exceeding $13,000, as depicted in chart 5. This indicates that under present loan conditions, they are capable of purchasing a residential property valued at $2 million. The data further implies significant spending ability among Bedok dwellers, some of whom may potentially be interested in acquiring a new home in the upcoming Bayshore estate.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"><img width="600" height="302" src="http://test0398.online/uploads/6302638fb5045258e91774fb4630a0.jpg" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_8" alt=""></b><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

Essentially, this new coastal district is anticipated to garner a lot of interest when the premier housing schemes kick off.
